# Basics Of Algorithmization and Programming - Labs
---
## Lab 1
> <big> The program calculates the following matrix expression:
> $$(A - B^2) \cdot (2 \cdot A + B)$$
> The matrices A and B have an order of 3. The user fills in matrices A and B.
> It is necessary to output intermediate and final calculation results.
> Write programs that use functions and procedures for calculation.
---
## Lab 2
> Conduct a comparative analysis of sorting algorithms using the selection sort and binary insertion sort methods. 
> The criterion is the number of comparisons during sorting.
> The array sizes are as follows: 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000.
> Types of arrays: random, sorted, reversed.

## Lab 4
#### Task 1
> The program generates a random group of people, where each person has a list of guests they have visited.
> It then checks whether there are individuals within the group who have not visited anyone and outputs their names.
> If every person in the group has visited at least one person, it displays a message indicating so.
#### Task 2
> Given a non-empty sequence of words consisting of lowercase Russian letters, with commas between adjacent words and a period after the last word.
> The task is to output all voiced consonant letters that appear in at least one word. The voiced consonant letters should be displayed in alphabetical order.

## Lab 5
> Create a text file by printing the first N rows of Pascal's triangle in a rectangular format. 
---
## Warm Up 1
> There are 10 points located on a plane, each defined by its coordinates. 
> Find a point on the X-axis such that the maximum distance from that point to the given points is minimized.
---
## Warm Up 2
> Given a string of arbitrary length, you need to write a program for encoding and decoding the string using the algorithm of circular traversal of a matrix from the center. The program should also take a key as input.
---
## Warm Up 3
> Input the number of hooks available to make the symbols "и" and "ш". Find the amount of possible sequences of these symbols and output the actual sequences that can be formed using the given number of hooks. 
> Write a program using iterations and recursion.
---
## Study Practice
> Develop a program (an "electronic matchmaker") for a matchmaking service. There are two lists: a list of grooms and a list of brides. 
> Each candidate (groom or bride) in the list is characterized by a record containing the following fields: candidate's serial number, candidate's information (name, age, height, weight, habits, hobbies), and partner preferences (in the form of a range of Min-Max for age, height, and weight). 
> The program should:
> - identify all possible pairs taking into account the candidates' preferences;
> - once both parties agree, the pair is considered formed, and the candidates are marked as removed from the list.
